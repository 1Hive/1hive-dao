Who does what

<br>

## Public Beta

1Hive is currently in public beta. This means everyone more or less does a bit of everything. That being said, 1Hive is also a DAO and has specific roles and permissions enforced via code. This page will try to explain how that works, but if you have any questiosn please ask in the #dao channel of our [Keybase chat](keybase.md)!

## Workers

Anyone can contribute to the 1Hive DAO by working engaging eith the community on Keybase, creating new Issues on GitHub, working on open Issues on GitHub. This does not require anyone's permission. Reviewers can assign tasks to the contributor's GitHub account and pay out HONEY bounties to the worker's Ethereum address upon successful completion. This does not require any permissions within the 1Hive DAO.

The roles and responsibilities of curators can be found [here](https://1hive.org/docs/contribute/projects-tasks.html#expectations-of-workers).

If a Worker earns (or purchases) HONEY, they will have HONEY voting rights within the [1Hive DAO](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/0xe520428C232F6Da6f694b121181f907931fD2211). This includes the following permissions in the HONEY token Voting app:
